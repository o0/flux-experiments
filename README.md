Application uses webpack as a build tool.

Steps to run local server:
```npm install```
```npm start```
```http://localhost:8080/```

Steps to build application:
```npm install```
```npm run build```

NB! Application won't work locally, because it uses manipulations with the browser history
and it is not supported for the file:// protocol.
